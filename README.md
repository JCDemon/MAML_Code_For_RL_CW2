# MAML_Code_For_RL_CW2

This project is developed based on https://github.com/MaximeVandegar/Papers-in-100-Lines-of-Code/tree/main/Model_Agnostic_Meta_Learning_for_Fast_Adaptation_of_Deep_Networks.
I've made some changes (including, plot of Loss over epochs and more few-shot learning tasks) to ensure the code satisfy the coursework requirement.


#How to reproduce the result?

run "Main.ipynb" in jupyter notebook
